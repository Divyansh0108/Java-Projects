Hi everyone, this is the second java project I've attempted using the current knowledge I have.

This project implements the use of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism,
basically does demonstrate the use of OOPs through a real-world hospital appointment booking model.

The task is really simple ( wish I could say the same about the code as of now lol), and I've tried to fit in some general primitive ways of booking an appointment.
The code is completely in java language, you can copy and run it on your system too, and make some changes if you wish to.

Thanks alot for taking a look at this code. 
Have a good one ahead!!
